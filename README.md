# Important Notice: Webservice Maintenance and Dlubal API Transition

**Dear Users,**

We would like to inform you that, effective **23.05.2025**, we are transitioning our existing Webservice into **maintenance mode**. This means that while the Webservice will continue to be available for existing use, **no new enhancements or functionality** will be added to it going forward.

For **new projects**, we highly recommend using the **[Dlubal API](https://www.dlubal.com/en/solutions/dlubal-api/dlubal-api-ii)**, now based on **gRPC**. The new Dlubal API offers improved performance, scalability, and modern capabilities designed to better support your applications.

### Key Points:
- **Webservice**: Still available for use, but will **not be enhanced** with new functionality.
- **[Dlubal API (gRPC)](https://www.dlubal.com/en/solutions/dlubal-api/dlubal-api-ii)**: Recommended for **new projects** as it provides better performance and modern features.

If you have any questions or need assistance with transitioning to the Dlubal API, please feel free to reach out to our support team.

Thank you for your continued support!

Welcome to RSTAB Python High Level Functions

<a href="https://www.dlubal.com/en/products/rstab-beam-structures/what-is-rstab" title="API"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dlubal-Software/RFEM_Python_Client/main/img/2Dtruss.gif" width=550 alt="Tutorial" /></a>
</h2>

Python client (high-level functions) for [RSTAB 9](https://www.dlubal.com/en/products/rstab-beam-structures/what-is-rstab) using [Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) (WS), [SOAP](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language). Available Python SOAP pkgs can be found on [wiki.python.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebServices#SOAP).


## Description
This Python project is focused on opening RSTAB 9 to all of our customers, enabling them to interact with RSTAB 9 on a much higher level. If you are looking for a tool to help you solve parametric models or optimization tasks, you have come to the right place. This community serves as a support portal and base for all of your future projects. The goal is to create an easily expandable Python library, which communicates instructions to RSTAB 9 through WebServices (WS). WS enables access to RSTAB 9 either via a local instance or a remote internet connection.


## Eyes on Upcoming Developmets! :eyes:

As you may have already heard, brand new WS features are in the works. Having support for Python scripting directly in the RSTAB, we have foundations to build completely new WS API which will be faster, have better access to results, and will have full compatibility with RSTAB Console.


## Architecture

* [![RSTAB](https://img.shields.io/badge/RSTAB-blue)](/RSTAB): folder following the structure of RSTAB 9 navigator containing individual types of objects
* [![initModel](https://img.shields.io/badge/initModel.py-blue)](/RSTAB/initModel.py): runs after window and initializes suds.Client by connecting to `http://localhost:8081/wsdl` and activating model in RSTAB. It also envelops essential global functions.
* [![enums](https://img.shields.io/badge/enums.py-blue)](/RSTAB/enums.py): definition of enumerations



## Getting started

### Dependencies
Dependency check is implemented inside [dependencies.py](RSTAB/dependencies.py) with option to install during execution.
* <img align="left" alt="PyPi" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dlubal-Software/RFEM_Python_Client/main/img/PyPI.png" style="padding-right:5px;">PyPi pkgs: [SUDS](https://github.com/cackharot/suds-py3), [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/), [mock](https://pypi.org/project/mock/), and [xmltodict](https://pypi.org/project/xmltodict/).

* <img align="left" alt="RSTAB" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dlubal-Software/RFEM_Python_Client/main/img/RSTAB.png" style="padding-right:5px;">RSTAB 9 application. Client is always compatible with the latest version.

### Step by step
1) üåÄ [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#:~:text=Cloning%20an%20Existing%20Repository) this repository (if you have GitHub account) or download actual [release](https://github.com/Dlubal-Software/RFEM_Python_Client/releases)

2) <img align="left" alt="RSTAB" width="18px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dlubal-Software/RFEM_Python_Client/main/img/RSTAB.png" style="padding-right:5px;"> Open RSTAB 9 application

3) ‚òëÔ∏è Check if there are no opened dialogues in RSTAB and server port range under *Options-Web Services* corresponds to the one set in initModel

4) üèÉ Run your script. Inspirations can be found in [Examples](/Examples/) or [UnitTests](/UnitTests/).

### Examples
The [scripts](https://github.com/Dlubal-Software/RSTAB_Python_Client/tree/main/Examples) are intended to be used as templates or examples. Also, they can be used for testing of backward compatibility.

### Unit Tests
Collection of [scripts](https://github.com/Dlubal-Software/RSTAB_Python_Client/tree/main/UnitTests) used to support further development.

## Python package üì¶
The easiest way to enjoy the Client is to install current [RSTAB package](https://pypi.org/project/RSTAB/) directly to your Python via `pip install RSTAB`. Especially if no code changes are required.
